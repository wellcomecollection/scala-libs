# CHANGELOG

## v32.38.0 - 2023-08-17

Remove the `sqsworker.alpakka` namespace, which is only used in the storage service.

## v32.37.0 - 2023-08-07

Remove the remaining bits of the Azure storage library, which is only used by the storage service.

## v32.36.0 - 2023-08-07

Remove the `storage.models` namespace, which is only used by the storage service.

## v32.35.0 - 2023-08-07

Remove the `storage.listing` namespace, which is only used by the storage service.

## v32.34.0 - 2023-08-07

Move the `storage.azure` and `storage.s3` packages into the `storage.providers` namespace for consistency.

## v32.33.0 - 2023-08-04

Remove the `services` namespace from the storage library, which is only used by the storage service.

## v32.32.0 - 2023-08-04

Remove the `tags` namespace from the storage library, which is only used in the storage service.

## v32.31.0 - 2023-08-04

Remove the S3PresignedUrls and S3Uploader classes, which are only used in the storage service.

## v32.30.0 - 2023-08-03

Remove the `transfer` namespace from the `storage` library, which is only used in the storage service.

## v32.29.0 - 2023-08-03

Bump the version of Circe to 0.14.5 to match elastic4s.

## v32.28.0 - 2023-08-03

Remove the unused PrefixTransferBuilder object from storage-typesafe.

## v32.27.0 - 2023-07-25

Bump elastic4s to v8.8.1 and matching Akka v2.6.20

## v32.26.0 - 2023-05-31

Restore the AWS CRT libraries, because their absence is causing the bag replicator to fail when transferring files >5GB in size.

## v32.25.0 - 2023-05-27

Remove the AWS CRT libraries, which are causing link issues in the bag replicator in the storage service:

> java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /tmp/AWSCRT_18127555281524790519libaws-crt-jni.so: Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such file or directory (needed by /tmp/AWSCRT_18127555281524790519libaws-crt-jni.so)

## v32.24.2 - 2023-02-07

Make S3StreamWritable more efficient; fix a bug when writing objects with empty bodies.

## v32.24.1 - 2023-01-30

Retry instances of `java.net.SocketException` when reading from S3.

## v32.24.0 - 2023-01-23

Remove an unused AzureBlobServiceClientBuilder object.

## v32.23.0 - 2023-01-23

Remove a bunch of one-line builder methods (e.g. S3Builder.buildS3Client), which can be inlined whenever called, removing an unnecessary bit of abstraction.

## v32.22.0 - 2023-01-13

Remove the `refreshInterval` setting from `IndexConfig`.

We originally used this to pause refreshes when doing reindexes in the catalogue pipeline,by setting refresh_interval=-1 to disable refreshes until a reindex was done.  This was intended to improve reindex performance.

In practice, it caused confusion, because the final index would appear to have 0 documents for no obvious reason.

We don't use this setting anywhere else, and we can run a performant reindex without this setting, so we're removing it.

## v32.21.1 - 2023-01-12

Return the CompleteMultipartUploadResponse from S3MultipartUploader.completeMultipartUpload.

## v32.21.0 - 2023-01-12

This changes the way S3StreamWritable works internally, so it should work better with our applications â€“ in particular it now uses a blocking S3 client, rather than an asynchronous S3TransferManager, which is a better fit for how we do concurrency elsewhere.

## v32.20.0 - 2023-01-09

This replaces the AWS Java V1 SDK for S3 with the Java V2 SDK.

All the previous storage-related classes should remain as-is, and just requires replacing the S3 clients which are passed in.

## v32.19.4 - 2023-01-06

Split out creating pre-signed S3 URLs from the S3Uploader class; there's a new S3PresignedUrls class.

This also simplifies the construction of AzurePutBlockFromURLTransfer.

This is more refactoring ahead of the V2 SDK upgrade: you need a different client for pre-signing URLs compared to other operations (`S3Presigner` / `S3Client`), and it makes sense to separate them now.

## v32.19.3 - 2023-01-06

Replace scality/s3server with zenko/cloudserver as the Docker image used to mimic S3 in tests.

## v32.19.2 - 2023-01-06

Provide better error messages in the LocalResources fixture.

## v32.19.1 - 2023-01-05

Start using the AWS Java V2 SDK for S3 for testing S3-related code.  This doesn't change any library code.

## v32.19.0 - 2023-01-05

Remove the `checkForExisting` flag from Transfer and TransferPrefix.

These classes will now *always* check for an existing object before overwriting it.

## v32.18.1 - 2023-01-05

Internal refactoring to prepare for the AWS Java V2 SDK for S3.

## v32.18.0 - 2023-01-05

Remove batchSize from S3ObjectLocationListing.

This is never set to a non-default value, so there should be no impact on downstream code.

Also contains some refactoring ahead of upgrading to the AWS Java V2 SDK for S3.

## v32.17.2 - 2022-11-09

This is some refactoring in the scala-libs build system; there are no changes to the library itself.

## v32.17.1 - 2022-10-27

Fix an issue where the `AzureTransfer` class might try to overwrite a blob in Azure if it got a transient error while trying to retrieve the blob in the destination.  Also log when objects/blobs are overwritten because the destination object can't be retrieved and it's not a 404 Not Found.

## v32.17.0 - 2022-08-26

Bump elastic4s version to 8.3.x

## v32.16.7 - 2022-08-25

Try to sort out the confusing nature of shapeless/scala version resolution

## v32.16.6 - 2022-08-25

Match circe version with that used in elastic4s

## v32.16.5 - 2022-08-25

Remove dependency on akka-http-json, vendor it

## v32.16.4 - 2022-08-08

Use the latest published version of elastic4s 7.x; match the akka version with it

## v32.16.3 - 2022-08-08

Add the API compatibility headers for the current version (7) of ElasticSearch

## v32.16.2 - 2022-07-15

Enable TCP keepalive for the Elasticsearch HTTP client in an effort to stop connection reset errors

## v32.16.1 - 2022-05-04

Recognise another type of socket connection timeout from S3 as a retryable error.

## v32.16.0 - 2022-04-27

Allow seeding an instance of `RandomGenerators` to get deterministic results.

## v32.15.0 - 2022-04-27

Add a helper for `withEnabled` to ElasticFieldOps.

## v32.14.1 - 2022-04-04

Retrieve the hold note when listing patron holds

## v32.14.0 - 2022-03-30

Made the `neededBy` field on a hold request optional, and added the ability to (optionally) specify a `note` on holds.

## v32.13.0 - 2022-03-07

Add a method for looking up a patron's patron type.

## v32.12.0 - 2022-03-07

Remove our Swagger dependencies.
We're moving away from autogenerated Swagger in code, and towards Swagger definitions written by hand.

## v32.11.2 - 2022-02-18

Remember to run *everything* on the Scala runners.

## v32.11.1 - 2022-02-18

Fix the build, by running on faster Scala runners.

## v32.11.0 - 2022-02-18

Updating the Sierra client to allow adding neededBy date

## v32.10.0 - 2022-01-26

*   Upgrade the version of akka-http and associated libraries
*   Return JSON errors for an HTTP 414 "URI Too Long", rather than the plaintext errors we were previously returning

## v32.9.1 - 2022-01-26

Remove some unused code from `messaging_typesafe`.
This should have no effect on downstream users.

## v32.9.0 - 2022-01-24

AlpakkaSQSWorker will retry a `TerminalFailure` if it determines that the error was a flaky error from somewhere in AWS, e.g. a DNS resolution error.

## v32.8.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up the `Result` types to reflect the desired behaviour (TerminalFailure, RetryableFailure, Successful) rather than their properties (Deterministic, NonDeterministic).
This will need to be changed in downstream code.

Additionally, the full body of any message deleted as a TerminalFailure will be logged, to make it easier to retry/redrive these messages later.

## v32.7.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up several traits which are only used in the `messaging` library, which were intended to be extensible but in practice only have one implementation.
There should be no effect on downstream users.

## v32.6.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up several traits which are only used in the `messaging` library, which were intended to be extensible but in practice only have one implementation.
There should be no effect on downstream users.

## v32.5.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up several traits which are only used in the `messaging` library, which were intended to be extensible but in practice only have one implementation.
There should be no effect on downstream users.

## v32.4.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up several traits which are only used in the `messaging` library, which were intended to be extensible but in practice only have one implementation.
There should be no effect on downstream users.

## v32.3.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up several traits which are only used in the messaging library, which were intended to be extensible but in practice only have one implementation. There should be no effect on downstream users.

## v32.2.0 - 2022-01-24

This release tidies up several traits which are only used in the `messaging` library, which were intended to be extensible but in practice only have one implementation.
There should be no effect on downstream users.

## v32.1.0 - 2022-01-21

This release removes a couple of classes and traits which aren't used anywhere outside the `messaging` library itself, and so can be removed without any effect on downstream users.

## v32.0.0 - 2022-01-21

This release rolls back some of the SNS error handling logic in v31.0.0, because it was too disruptive downstream and I found a simpler path forward.

## v31.0.0 - 2022-01-21

This release adds better retrying when there are network connectivity issues with SNS and S3, in particular:

-   when we can resolve the endpoint, but can't connect
-   when we can't resolve the endpoint

Both of these errors will be instances of `RetryableError`, and should be retried appropriately.

As a side effect, the signature of `MessageSender.send` has changed from `Try[Unit]` to `Either[MessageSender, Unit]`, so we can better distinguish errors when we send message notifications.
Downstream users will need to adapt to the new function signature, and may want to add tests that they retry any errors that are marked as retryable.

## v30.15.0 - 2022-01-20

Switch to using the officially provided DynamoDB Local image from AWS.

## v30.14.0 - 2022-01-20

Change our DynamoDB fixture to use a LocalStack container to mock cloud services, instead of the `peopleperhour/dynamodb` container we were using previously.
The `peopleperhour` image is no longer maintained, and prevents us from using newer SNS APIs in our libraries.

Downstream users will need to replace `peopleperhour/dynamodb` with `localstack` in their Docker Compose files.

## v30.13.0 - 2022-01-19

Change our SNS and SQS fixture to use a LocalStack container to mock cloud services, instead of the `fake-sns` and `elasticmq` containers we were using previously.
The `fake-sns` image is no longer maintained, and prevents us from using newer SNS APIs in our libraries.

Downstream users will need to replace `elasticmq` with `localstack` in their Docker Compose files.

## v30.12.1 - 2021-12-08

Fix a typo that meant the "elasticsearch" library wasn't being published.

## v30.12.0 - 2021-12-08

Add a method for looking up the expiration date of a patron's Sierra record.

## v30.11.5 - 2021-12-07

This fixes the scala-libs build process for the new version of the Buildkite stack, but should have no user-visible changes.

## v30.11.4 - 2021-11-05

Add implicit JSON decoders/encoders for `NotificationMessage`.
This should make compilation a little faster but otherwise have no user-visible effect.

## v30.11.3 - 2021-11-04

Make `LargeStreamReaderCannotReadRange` a case class so you can actually extract the values.

## v30.11.2 - 2021-11-04

This patch adds a dedicated exception `LargeStreamReaderCannotReadRange` to the LargeStreamReader.

If the large stream reader is unable to read a particular chunk, it exposes all the relevant information so an upstream caller can react appropriately (e.g. providing a more user-friendly error message).

## v30.11.1 - 2021-10-28

This changes how we log HTTP requests.
Our current logs are fairly noisy, and split across three lines:

> 08:42:26.038 [main-actor-system-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-26] INFO akka.actor.ActorSystemImpl - SearchApi/b15d78e0-af82-4630-aaa8-49000ee3bb3d: Response for
> Request : HttpRequest(HttpMethod(GET),http://localhost:8888/works/qqqmwej7?include=identifiers,images,items,subjects,genres,contributors,production,notes,parts,partOf,precededBy,succeededBy,languages,holdings,List(Timeout-Access: <function1>, Host: localhost:8888, Connection: close, Accept-Encoding: gzip, elastic-apm-traceparent: 00-a8471e6468afac466583488f55f70f62-e070a1f1322fb613-01, traceparent: 00-a8471e6468afac466583488f55f70f62-e070a1f1322fb613-01, tracestate: es=s:1, User-Agent: Amazon CloudFront, Via: 1.1 5375075eb87a09bb90c63fb4a8d064f4.cloudfront.net (CloudFront), X-Amz-Cf-Id: baxKLJQNmWTDwysAsqsSRZAYYTwFlfB5k95dJHLGlBN5NrR1SBTE9A==, X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=1-617a6272-56a62abd10473a27311cfa64, X-Forwarded-For: 34.240.107.39, 64.252.133.110, X-Forwarded-Port: 443, X-Forwarded-Proto: https, x-amzn-apigateway-api-id: 4fd60k0q27),HttpEntity.Strict(none/none,0 bytes total),HttpProtocol(HTTP/1.0))
> Response: Complete(HttpResponse(200 OK,List(),HttpEntity.Strict(application/json,3256 bytes total),HttpProtocol(HTTP/1.1)))

This is because we were using the akka-http DebuggingDirectives, which log everything.

Now we construct our own log lines, which are significantly more compact:

> 08:42:26.038 [main-actor-system-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-26] INFO akka.actor.ActorSystemImpl - SearchApi/b15d78e0-af82-4630-aaa8-49000ee3bb3d - Request: GET /works/qqqmwej7?include=identifiers,images,items,subjects,genres,contributors,production,notes,parts,partOf,precededBy,succeededBy,languages,holdings / Response: HTTP 200 OK; HttpEntity.Strict(application/json,3256 bytes total)

This has a number of benefits:

*   The request/response are logged on the same line, so it'll be easier to pair them up in the logging cluster.
*   There's less noise from headers we don't care about.
*   We have to explicitly label the headers we want to log, so we aren't going to inadvertently log sensitive information in headers (for example, authentication tokens).

## v30.11.0 - 2021-10-04

This release changes our Elasticsearch client to always use compression.

This should have no user-visible effect, but it should reduce our data-transfer bill.

## v30.10.0 - 2021-09-17

Add a new helper trait for read files from the "resources" folder in the fixtures library.

## v30.9.0 - 2021-09-16

Adds status,varFields fields in requests to the Sierra items API endpoint

## v30.8.1 - 2021-09-16

Get slightly better error messages from the assertions in ElasticsearchFixtures.

## v30.8.0 - 2021-09-15

This rolls back the version bump in v30.7.0.
This has led to SQS-backed workers getting stuck with errors like:

    Caused by: software.amazon.awssdk.core.exception.SdkClientException:
    Unable to execute HTTP request: The channel was closed. This may have been
    done by the client (e.g. because the request was aborted), by the service
    (e.g. because there was a handshake error, the request took too long, or
    the client tried to write on a read-only socket), or by an intermediary
    party (e.g. because the channel was idle for too long).

I suspect this was caused by an unexpected upgrade of the AWS SDK, from 2.14.22 (in [Scanamo v1.0-M14](https://github.com/scanamo/scanamo/blob/v1.0-M14/build.sbt#L125)) to 2.15.78 (in [Scanamo v1.0.0-M15](https://github.com/scanamo/scanamo/blob/v1.0.0-M15/build.sbt#L125)).
We're probably missing a configuration option that's required in the newer version, or something has gone bang in the dependency resolution.

This change didn't have the compilation improvement I was hoping for with the Circe/Shapeless change, so I'm rolling it back for now.

## v30.7.0 - 2021-09-15

Bump to the latest version of Circe and Scanamo.
Really I'm hoping to get the latest version of Shapeless, which might come with compiler performance improvements.

## v30.6.5 - 2021-09-14

Remove some unused or now-defunct code from the messaging tests.
This should have no user-visible effect.

## v30.6.4 - 2021-09-09

All instances of StorageError now include a custom exception message.
This should be easier to debug than seeing `java.lang.Error: null` in the logs.

## v30.6.3 - 2021-09-08

Remove a couple of unused imports from tests.
This should have now downstream impact.

## v30.6.2 - 2021-09-08

VersionedStore.put is now idempotent.
That is, if you call `put(id, t)` with the same values repeatedly, it will succeed â€“ previously it would through VersionAlreadyExistsError or HigherVersionExists on subsequent calls.

## v30.6.1 - 2021-09-06

Tidy up some unused methods on ElasticsearchFixtures.

## v30.6.0 - 2021-08-24

This changes the way we inspect queue sizes in the SQS fixture: rather than waiting for the visibility timeout to expire, we inspect the queue metrics for all messages (visible, in-flight, delayed), and compare those to the expected size.

This should make all tests using `assertQueueSize` or `assertQueueEmpty` both more accurate and a lot faster.

## v30.5.0 - 2021-08-20

### Libraries affected

`sierra`

### Description

Adds SierraSource service for interacting with Sierra to retrieve and create holds.

## v30.4.1 - 2021-08-16

## v30.1.1 - 2021-07-27

Fix a bug in the LockingService where locks weren't being released correctly if there was a partial locking failure.

e.g. if you tried to lock (A, B, C), successfully locked A and B but failed to lock C, then the locks for A and B wouldn't be released.
Now they get released correctly.

## v30.1.0 - 2021-07-26

This release removes all the use of `SqsClient`, because everywhere else in our projects we've switched exclusively to `SqsAsyncClient`.

## v30.0.0 - 2021-07-14

This release removes all the typesafe config for AWS-related config, in particular:

- `aws.region` -- use the `AWS_REGION` environment variable instead
-	`aws.key` -- use the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable instead
-	`aws.secret` -- use the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable instead
- `aws.max-connections` -- this was never used in practice
- `aws.endpoint` -- there is no alternative to this for now

## v29.3.0 - 2021-07-14

Allow specifying global options for AWS client config, e.g. you can configure a default AWS region with

```
aws.region=${?aws_region
```

rather than having to specify it for every namespace/AWS service that you're using.

## v29.2.0 - 2021-07-08

The SQS.Queue fixture now takes a Duration instead of an Int, to match the withLocalSqsQueue helper methods.

## v29.1.1 - 2021-07-08

This release removes the unused type WellcomeApp and ensures that errors starting & configuring a service result in a service exiting.

## v29.1.0 - 2021-07-05

This patch removes the use of context URLs throughout our HTTP libraries.

## v29.0.0 - 2021-07-02

The `withLocalSqsQueue` fixture now takes an instance of a Scala Duration instead of an Int, and increases the default timeout from 1 second to 5 seconds.

## v28.0.0 - 2021-06-25

Rename all uses of the `uk.ac.wellcome` namespace to `weco`.

## v27.1.0 - 2021-06-25

*   EnrichConfig now has helpers for getDurationOption and requireDuration
*   The Dynamo locking config now uses a `scala.concurrent.Duration` for the expiryTime rather than a `java.time.Duration`, and the expiry time is configurable in the typesafe builder with the `aws.dynamo.lockExpiryTime` config flag.

## v27.0.0 - 2021-06-22

### Libraries affected

`elasticsearch`

### Description

Converts IndexConfig from an `object` to a `case class`.

This is to better reflect the way IndexConfig is used across the code base
i.e. as immutable data structures.

Add some creation ops from type config to IndexConfig.

## v26.19.1 - 2021-06-21

### Libraries affected

`elasticsearch`

### Description

## v26.17.5 - 2021-06-14

Provide a better error message if you pass invalid JSON to HttpFixtures.createJsonHttpEntityWith().

## v26.17.4 - 2021-06-14

Don't hard-code a version of the Sierra API in SierraOauthHttpClient.

## v26.17.3 - 2021-06-11

Tweak AkkaHttpClient so it logs requests and a baseUri isn't required.

## v26.17.2 - 2021-06-10

Bump elasticsearch and elastic4s to 7.12.2

## v26.14.0 - 2021-05-13

Add a TypedString type for times when we want to use a type in place of a string, but we still want the value to serialise as a string in JSON/DynamoDB.

We already have code for this in various places; this consolidates it into one place.

## v26.13.0 - 2021-05-13

This adds TimeAssertions to the fixtures library.

## v26.12.3 - 2021-05-07

Fix contextUrl leaking into fixture

## v26.12.2 - 2021-05-07

The elasticsearch_typesafe library now requires that you configure at least a host, username and password.

## v26.12.1 - 2021-05-07

## v26.9.0 - 2021-04-30

Add WellcomeHttpApp

## v26.8.0 - 2021-04-29

Adds Tracing trait supporting APM tracing to typesafe_app lib, in order to make it available to all apps by default.

## v26.7.3 - 2021-04-27

Bump the version of akka-http to 10.1.11 (but actually correctly).

## v26.7.2 - 2021-04-27

Bump the version of akka-http to 2.6.11.

Tweak the behaviour of FutureDirectives.

## v26.7.1 - 2021-04-27

Make the printer on `DisplayJsonUtil` an implicit value.

## v26.7.0 - 2021-04-27

This release add the `ErrorDirectives` and `FutureDirectives` traits.
These are split out from the `CustomDirectives` traits that used to live in our application repos.

It also adds `akka-http-circe` as a dependency of the http lib.

## v26.6.0 - 2021-04-26

This release adds the shared `HttpMetrics` class.

## v26.5.0 - 2021-04-26

Add the first piece of a shared HTTP library, with some models from the catalogue API.

## v26.4.3 - 2021-03-22

This patch makes the locking service slightly more efficient in scenarios where multiple processes are trying to acquire overlapping sets of locks.

## v26.4.2 - 2021-03-22

SQSStream and AlpakkaSQSWorker are now using DeleteMessageBatch rather than DeleteMessage.
This should have no user-visible effects.

## v26.4.1 - 2021-03-16

Add possibility to update metadata supplied in an index mapping.

## v26.4.0 - 2021-03-11

Add `elasticsearch` and `elasticsearch_typesafe` modules

## v26.3.2 - 2021-02-17

If a service using `WellcomeApp` throws a terminal exception, it should actually stop running.
Currently, services hang around forever until they get purged by autoscaling.

## v26.3.1 - 2021-02-16

Adds a method to RandomGenerators for taking a random sample from a given Seq

## v26.3.0 - 2021-02-03

Adds the option to pass to SQSStream a function that creates an entire RunnableGraph from a source and sink.

## v26.2.1 - 2021-02-02

Add some tests to describe dynamo formatting behaviour

## v26.2.0 - 2021-01-20

Roll back the AWS SDK and other dependencies to known good versions.

## v26.1.0 - 2021-01-20

Bump the version of Alpakka Streams to 2.0.2.

## v26.0.2 - 2021-01-19

Fix a typo in an error log from SQSStream.

## v26.0.1 - 2021-01-19

Log failures from a MessageSender as an error.  This should make SNS failures more obvious.

## v26.0.0 - 2021-01-18

This release bumps the version of Scanamo to 1.0-M13, and the AWS SDK for DynamoDB to V2.

## v25.1.2 - 2021-01-14

This release changes DynamoLockDao to use BatchWriteItem to release locks.  This will have no impact on callers, but should make unlocking faster and cheaper if you lock multiple IDs.

## v25.1.1 - 2021-01-12

Remove a now-unused custom DynamoFormat for S3ObjectLocation.
We wrote this format when we changed the S3ObjectLocation model from namespace/path to bucket/key, to allow our Scala apps to read old-style locations.
We've now migrated our DynamoDB tables to use the new-style locations exclusively, so this translation code can be removed.

## v25.1.0 - 2021-01-05

### Libraries affected

`typesafe_app`

### Description

*   Remove some deprecated and now-unused methods on EnrichConfig
*   Add a new getBooleanOption method to EnrichConfig

## v25.0.4 - 2020-12-17

### Libraries affected

`messaging`

### Description

Log warning when receive throwable in SQSStream

## v25.0.3 - 2020-12-14

Expose the underlying stores in a VersionedHybridStore and a HybridStore as public attributes.

## v25.0.2 - 2020-12-14

Treat a `NativeIoException` when reading a blob from Azure as retryable.

## v25.0.1 - 2020-12-08

The error type of Maxima.max() should be MaximaError, not ReadError.

## v25.0.0 - 2020-12-08

This release changes the behaviour of Maxima to return an `Identified[_, _]`, rather than a single value.
This reduces doing double-lookups if you want to get the max version of something in a store, and retrieve the whole record rather than just the max version.

The practical upshot for our code is that if you call `getLatest(â€¦)`, now you're making a single request to DynamoDB rather than two.

## v24.6.1 - 2020-12-02

Improve the efficiency of reading items from the Dynamo stores.

## v24.6.0 - 2020-11-24

Bump the version of akka to 2.6.10.

## v24.5.0 - 2020-11-24

Bump scalatest to 3.2.3 and scalatestplus-mockito to 3.1.2.0.

## v24.4.0 - 2020-11-23

Allow consistency to be set from DynamoSingleVersionStore, DynamoMultipleVersionStore

## v24.3.2 - 2020-11-20

Removes unused travis things

## v24.3.1 - 2020-11-20

Fix a flaky test in S3TagsTest.

## v24.3.0 - 2020-11-19

The `DynamoReadable` trait (and all extensions of it) now have a new field `consistencyMode`, which allows you to decide between:

*   **Eventually consistent reads**, which might not return data from a recent write operation
*   **Strongly consistent reads**, whcih always return the most recent data, but with higher latency and using more throughput capacity

The default is eventual consistency, which is the existing behaviour.

## v24.2.0 - 2020-11-19

Don't build scaladocs

## v24.1.1 - 2020-10-29

### Libraries affected

All (but no external changes)

### Description

Bump SBT version to 1.4.1

## v24.1.0 - 2020-10-26

Bump Akka to 2.6.9.  This is required for the latest version of elastic4s (7.9.1).

## v24.0.0 - 2020-10-22

### Libraries affected

messaging, monitoring

### Description

*   Metrics.recordValue() no longer takes an optional `metricUnit` parameter, because none of our code was using it.
*   MetricsMonitoringClient has been removed.  Any uses of it can be replaced by an instance of Metrics[Future].

## v23.0.0 - 2020-10-07

This release tidies up the random generators provided by `RandomGenerators`.  This trait should be the canonical source of random data for tests in the platform, rather than multiple implementations of very similar functions copy/pasted into different codebases.

## v22.0.0 - 2020-10-01

Add retry for 500 errors from S3 in `S3Transfer`

## v21.0.0 - 2020-09-24

Add a mandatory `signedUrlExpiry` parameter to `AzurePutBlockFromUrlTransfer` contructor that specifies how long the presigned URL from S3 should be valid for.

## v20.0.0 - 2020-09-22

Add some generic classes used in the storage-service:
* ByteRange and ByteRangeUtil
* SizeFinder
* RangedReader
* LargeStreamReader
* ObjectExists
* S3Uploader
* AzurePrefixTransfer and AzureTransfer

Delete classes that are not going to be used:
* AzureBlobMetadata
* S3ToAzurePrefixTransfer and S3ToAzureTransfer

## v19.6.1 - 2020-09-16

Add retry logic for TimeoutException in AzureStorageErrors

## v19.6.0 - 2020-09-08

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Allow creating an instance of `S3ObjectLocation` from an `S3ObjectSummary`.

## v19.5.6 - 2020-08-28

### Libraries affected

All

### Description

Bumps the AKKA version

## v19.5.5 - 2020-08-27

Add a defaults to `randomInt` in `fixtures` (also for buildkite testing)

## v19.5.4 - 2020-08-24

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Make the warning introduced in v19.5.3 a bit less chatty.  In particular, the Listing classes no longer warn if you try to list a prefix with an empty path -- i.e., the complete contents of an S3 bucket or Azure container.

## v19.5.3 - 2020-08-20

Warn that listing the contents of an S3/Azure prefix that doesn't end in a slash may include unexpected objects.

e.g. listing `bags/v1` will return everything under `bags/v1/`, but also `bags/v10/`.

This may be the desired behaviour, so listing a prefix that doesn't end with a slash isn't forbidden, but hopefully this makes it easier to debug if weird things are happening.

## v19.5.2 - 2020-08-19

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

The `S3Tags` class will now retry writing tags to S3 if it receives a transient error from the SetObjectTagging API.

## v19.5.1 - 2020-08-19

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Internal refactoring and cleanups in RetryOps and RetryReadable.

## v19.5.0 - 2020-08-18

Remove the implicit DynamoFormat[ExpiringLock] parameter from the lock dao and instead provide it internally, therefore preventing inconsistent formatting.

## v19.4.4 - 2020-08-17

Remember to close streams that get opened in S3toAzureTransfer, otherwise you get the error:

> Unable to execute HTTP request: Timeout waiting for connection from pool

## v19.4.3 - 2020-08-10

Allow a trailing slash in an S3ObjectLocationPrefix and an AzureBlobLocationPrefix.

This also improves the error handling of illegal keys.

## v19.4.2 - 2020-08-06

Disallow using `.` and `..` in an S3ObjectLocation key and an AzureBlobLocation name.

In a filesystem, these entries mean "current directory" and "parent directory", but object stores like S3 and Azure Blob Storage aren't filesystems.
These characters cause issues in the console, and their semantics aren't the same as in regular filesystems.

e.g. on a filesystem, `alfa/./bravo` is equivalent to `alfa/bravo`, but these could be two distinct objects in S3

In general we never expect to be creating objects that include these entries in the path, so for now outright block them rather than trying to handle them.
**We can review this limitation if we need to support such keys, but we should consider the semantics carefully.**

## v19.4.1 - 2020-08-06

Add some tests that we remove double slashes when joining paths.

This isn't a change in behaviour, just a new test to avoid regressing this behaviour in future.

## v19.4.0 - 2020-08-06

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Add a constructor for `AzureTypedStore`, `S3toAzureTransfer` and `S3toAzurePrefixTransfer` that take implicit S3 and Azure clients, saving callers from constructing the intermediate classes.

## v19.3.1 - 2020-08-05

`send` on `MemoryIndividualMessageSender` now updates its internal message list using `synchronized` to prevent dropping entries with concurrent writes.

## v19.3.0 - 2020-07-29

### Libraries affected

`messaging`

### Description

Remove the `NotificationStream` class and the associated fixture and builders, which aren't used anywhere in the platform.

## v19.2.0 - 2020-07-29

Remove some unneeded Materializer instances:

In [Akka 2.6](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/migration-guide-2.5.x-2.6.x.html#materializer-changes), you don't need to supply an implicit Materializer if there's an implicit ActorSystem:

> A default materializer is now provided out of the box. For the Java API just pass system when running streams, for Scala an implicit materializer is provided if there is an implicit ActorSystem available. This avoids leaking materializers and simplifies most stream use cases somewhat.

The `withMaterializer(actorSystem: ActorSystem)` method has been removed from the `Akka` fixture; you can remove it anywhere it's used and rely on the implicit materializer.

## v19.1.0 - 2020-07-27

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

This adds `basename`, `parent` and `asLocation` methods to `Prefix[_ <: Location]`.

## v19.0.0 - 2020-07-24

Replace the remaining uses of `ObjectLocation` with `S3ObjectLocation` or `MemoryLocation` throughout the storage library.

## v18.0.0 - 2020-07-24

Change the `S3Listing` and `S3Transfer` classes to use the new-style locations.

Replace all uses of `ObjectLocation` with `S3ObjectLocation` to get the new behaviour; the two classes are compatible.

## v17.0.0 - 2020-07-23

Change the `S3Tags` class to use the new-style locations.

Replace all uses of `ObjectLocation` with `S3ObjectLocation` to get the new behaviour; the two classes are compatible.

## v16.0.0 - 2020-07-23

Change all the Azure-related storage classes to use the new-style locations.

Replace all uses of `ObjectLocation` with `AzureBlobLocation` to get the new behaviour; the two classes are compatible.

## v15.0.0 - 2020-07-23

Changes to the `TransferResult` type hierarchy; refactoring in the Transfer and PrefixTransfer classes to make it easier to switch to new-style locations in the next patch.

## v14.2.0 - 2020-07-23

This release introduces four new classes in the **storage** library:

-   `S3ObjectLocation`
-   `S3ObjectLocationPrefix`
-   `AzureBlobLocation`
-   `AzureBlobLocationPrefix`

which extend new traits `Location` and `Prefix`, respectively.

These will eventually replace the existing `ObjectLocation` class, but `S3ObjectLocation` should be a drop-in replacement in all existing code.

## v14.1.0 - 2020-07-14

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Store Instants in Dynamo as *seconds* since the epoch, not *milliseconds*.

## v14.0.6 - 2020-06-24

No changes, trying to fix build.

## v14.0.5 - 2020-06-24

No changes, trying to fix build.

## v14.0.4 - 2020-06-24

No changes, updates the fmt-sbt-s3-resolver plugin to avoid the dependency error described here: https://github.com/frugalmechanic/fm-sbt-s3-resolver/pull/56

## v14.0.3 - 2020-06-24

No changes - updates build system.

## v14.0.2 - 2020-06-24

No changes - updates build system.

## v14.0.1 - 2020-06-23

No user-facing changes. Splits the build steps in CI for the scala-libs repo to increase potential parallelism in builds, and to make it clearer where failures occur.

## v14.0.0 - 2020-06-23

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

This removes the type `HybridStoreEntry` meaning that for some types `Id` and `Data`, instead of `HybridStore` being a

```
Store[Id, HybridStoreEntry[Data, Metadata]
```

it is now a

```
Store[Id, Data]
```

This is an improvement for any code that might use a hybrid store, as previously anywhere that wanted to use it had to encode the fact that a hybrid store was being used, even though this is just an implementation detail and should not really be part of the interface (we generally should only care that some `Id` maps to some `Data`, and should abstract away the internal details of the storage).

This means that we can remove workarounds such as
[here](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/catalogue/blob/2013710c9bd54fa8644f3b2c3bb618af714a2554/common/big_messaging/src/main/scala/uk/ac/wellcome/bigmessaging/VHS.scala#L50-L77).

Note that the ability to store metadata in the IndexedStore (i.e. DynamoDB) is now not possible: this is only used in the Miro VHS, which does not use the current `HybridStore` interface anyway, being created with an older schema for the data. Storing metadata is such a way should now be considered deprecated.

## v13.1.0 - 2020-06-23

### Libraries affected

`storage_typesafe`

Adds a builder for PrefixTransfer

With config:

```hocon
source.cloudProvider = "aws"
destination {
  cloudProvider = "azure"
  azure.blobStore.connectionString = "UseDevelopmentStorage=true;"
}
```

In code:

```scala
import uk.ac.wellcome.storage.typesafe.PrefixTransferBuilder

val prefixTransfer = PrefixTransferBuilder.build(config)
assert(prefixTransfer.isInstanceOf[S3toAzurePrefixTransfer])
```

## v13.0.0 - 2020-06-23

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Roll back all the changes in v12.0.0.  We do want to split `ObjectLocation` eventually, but doing it in one fell swoop is far too big a patch (and blocks other changes to these libraries).

## v12.0.0 - 2020-06-22

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

`ObjectLocation` has been removed, and replaced with provider-specific classes `S3ObjectLocation` and `AzureBlobLocation`.
Similar classes exist for `LocationPrefix`.

These two classes have the same semantics as ObjectLocation, but now encode and enforce the associated provider -- so you can't, for example, ask Azure for an object that's stored in S3.

*Note:* Because the field names are now provider-specific, encoding these classes as JSON will give different output.
The library includes decoders so this distinction will be hidden when using the library, but may cause issues for anything else that reads the JSON.

Previously:

```json
{"namespace": "my-great-bucket", "path": "myfile.txt"}
```

Now (S3):

```json
{"bucket": "my-great-bucket", "key": "myfile.txt"}
```

Now (Azure):

```json
{"container": "my-great-container", "name": "myfile.txt"}
```

## v11.5.0 - 2020-06-22

### Libraries affected

`storage_typesafe`

### Description

Adds a `TagsBuilder` object to create the appropriate `Tags` class for the specified `CloudProvider`.

For config:

```hocon
somepath {
  cloudProvider = "azure"
  azure.blobStore.connectionString = "UseDevelopmentStorage=true;"
}
``` 

In code:

```scala
import uk.ac.wellcome.storage.typesafe.TagsBuilder

val tags = TagsBuilder.buildClient(config)

assert(tags.isInstanceOf(AzureBlobMetadata))
```

## v11.4.0 - 2020-06-19

### Libraries affected

`typesafe_app`

### Description

Updates `EnrichConfig` to add:

- `getStringOption`
- `requireString`
- `getIntOption`
- `requireInt`

Deprecates:

- `get[T]`
- `getOrElse[T]`
- `required[T]`

This change is to provide working extraction of optional `Int` & `String` config.

## v11.3.0 - 2020-06-18

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Adds support for transferring objects between S3 and Azure Blob Storage with `S3toAzureTransfer` and `S3toAzurePrefixTransfer`.

## v11.2.0 - 2020-06-18

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Adds support for listing the blobs in an Azure Blob Storage container through `AzureBlobItemListing` and `AzureObjectLocationListing`.

## v11.1.0 - 2020-06-18

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Adds Azure support for `Tags` in the shape of `AzureBlobMetadata`.

```scala
implicit val azureClient: BlobServiceClient =
  new BlobServiceClientBuilder()
    .connectionString("UseDevelopmentStorage=true;")
    .buildClient()

val azureBlobMetadata = new AzureBlobMetadata()

// Get tags
val objectLocation = ObjectLocation("mycontainer","myobject.txt")
val getResult: Either[ReadError, Identified[Ident, T]]  = azureBlobMetadata.get(objectLocation)

val newTags = Map("owner" -> "jill")
val updateResult: Either[UpdateError, Identified[Ident, T]] = azureBlobMetadata.update(objectLocation) { oldTags =>
    oldTags ++ newTags 
}
```

## v11.0.0 - 2020-06-18

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

`RetryableGet` has been replaced in favour of `RetryableReadable`. 

A new trait `Updatable` has been made available and is used in `Tags`.

```scala
trait Updatable[Ident, T] {
  type UpdateEither = Either[UpdateError, Identified[Ident, T]]
  type UpdateFunction = T => Either[UpdateFunctionError, T]

  def update(id: Ident)(updateFunction: UpdateFunction): UpdateEither
}
```

`Tags` now meets the interfaces of  to `RetryableReadable` and `Updatable`.

Consumers will need to update code where `update` and `get` have been used on `S3Tags`.

## v10.1.0 - 2020-06-17

### Libraries affected

`storage`

### Description

Adds support for an [Azure Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/storage/blobs/) implementation of `StreamStore`.


#### Usage
```scala
import com.azure.storage.blob.{BlobServiceClient, BlobServiceClientBuilder}
import uk.ac.wellcome.storage.store.azure.AzureStreamStore

implicit val azureClient: BlobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClientBuilder()
  .connectionString("UseDevelopmentStorage=true;")
  .buildClient()

val streamStore = new AzureStreamStore()
```

This change also introduces the ability to skip stream length tests as part of the stream store test suite as we are not able to verify those tests for Azure Blob storage with the [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite) test containers.

## v10.0.4 - 2020-06-16

### Libraries affected

`messaging`

### Description

Localstack is not compatable with the SQS fixtures here, so remove it.

## v10.0.3 - 2020-06-16

### Libraries affected

`messaging`

### Description

The `getQueueAttribute` was using the default `sqsClient`

## v10.0.2 - 2020-06-15

bump to release all libraries

## v10.0.0 - 2020-06-12

Moved all libs to new repo.
